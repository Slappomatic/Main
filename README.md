# UdacityMovieTrailer
My Udacity movie trailer project
This is a website that was created to show off my favorite movies and provide you with the trailer


# Configuration
Needed files include entertainment_center.py, fresh_tomoatoes.py, media.py, and movies.txt.  The movies.txt is a pipe("|") delimited file
that contains the movie title, description of the movie, the location of the movie poster or artwork for the movie, and the url of the youtube
trailer.  For example, The Last Jedi|Luke trains his new apprentice|The Last Jedi.jpg|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB4I68XVPzQ.


# Installation
This will run on any browser window that supports python


# Usage
Enter in the complete directory structure of the directory you saved the files to, into the address bar of any browser.
